Appraise has been used as a base for Ekaterina Ageeva's Google Summer of Code project, Assimilation Evaluation Toolkit.
The scripts for creating assimilation evaluation tasks and processing their results have been created by Ekaterina
Ageeva. These scripts can be found in /eval.
The Appraise platform, created by Christian Federmann, was modified to accommodate the new task type.
The modified files can be found in /appraise and include the following:

- evaluation/models.py
- evaluation/views.py
- templates/evaulation/gisting.html
