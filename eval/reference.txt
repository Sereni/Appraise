Corpora in linguistics are large collections of texts enhanced with special markup. They allow linguists to search the texts by various parameters in order to discover phenomena and patterns in the natural language. Corpus studies are the state of the art method in most areas of linguistics. In the recent years, corpora started to make their way into other humanities, such as history, sociology or psychology.
